										<!-- <p>Software engineering, AI research, Human-centered design</p> -->
										<!-- <p>B.S. in Computer Science & Psychology minor at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (Spring 2021).</p> -->
									</header>
									
									<p>I am a CS PhD student at the University of Washington, researching how to build agents/robots that enhance the users' autonomy while aligning with their goals. My work lies at the intersection of human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence, and alignment. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Maya Cakmak and Prof. Max Kleiman-Weiner. Additionally, I am grateful to be supported by the NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship and the UW Paul G. Allen Diamond Fellowship.
										<!-- <br><br> I previously worked as a backend software engineer at HubSpot, applying Generative AI research to create innovative interactions and products. I am passionate about engaging with local non-profits through UX design volunteer work, and I also have experience consulting and leading teams in both academia and industry. I love learning, staying active, and giving back to my community in whatever way possible. -->

									<h3>Research</h3>
								</header>
								<!-- <p>My research background is primarily in human computer interaction and how artificial intelligence can model human
									behavior and decision making. In my career, I aim to combine these interests to investigate how we can center
									diverse human needs while developing algorithms/building systems to improve people's well-being. I intend to approach this work from diverse perspectives–I believe that this research requires not only creating new technologies, but also inquiring how they interact with and impact different populations, both during the creation process and upon
									deployment.</p> -->
