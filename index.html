										<h3>Hi there!</h3>
									</header>
									
									<p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. My research spans human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence, and alignment, with applications to both embodied and virtual AI systems. I am particularly interested in the key challenges in aligning agentic/robotic assistance with users' goals. This broadly encompasses learning human preferences, investigating intrinsic motivation objectives for assistive agents, and developing shared autonomy systems that balance robotic assistance with user control. <br><br>I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.mayacakmak.io/home">Maya Cakmak</a> and <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/maxkw/">Max Kleiman-Weiner</a>. Additionally, I am grateful to be supported by the NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship and the UW Paul G. Allen Diamond Fellowship.

									<h3>Research</h3>
								</header>
								<p>My research interests have always been motivated by my curiosity around human behavior and desire to create technology informed by people's needs. This strand has persisted throughout my research journey, starting in undergrad and through my PhD program.</p>

									<h5>Human-Centered Robotics Lab and Computational Minds & Machines Lab, advised by Maya Cakmak and Max Kleiman-Weiner, Sep 2024–present<div id="line-break"></div>
										<i>Graduate Researcher</i>
									</h5>
									<p>
										Researching human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence, and alignment. Advised by Prof. Maya Cakmak and Prof. Max Kleiman-Weiner. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19202">My first paper</a> investigating how robot autonomy affects user agency was accepted at RO-MAN 2025! I am currently researching disempowerment resulting from assistance in multi-agent scenarios, which I presented as a poster at CogSci 2025.
